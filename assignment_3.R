# In this assignment we are interested if 
# Males go more frequently to doctors than females. In order to answer this question we do an analysis on
#   a cross-section data originating from the 1977â€“1978 Australian Health Survey.

# 0) Clear work space
rm( list = ls ( ) )

# 1) Load tidyverse and modelsummary packages and install and load the "AER" package
library( tidyverse )
library( modelsummary )

install.packages( "AER" )
library( AER )

# Load the data of doctor visits from AER package (more info: https://rdrr.io/cran/AER/man/DoctorVisits.html)

data( "DoctorVisits", package = "AER" )
df <- DoctorVisits

# 2) Make a quick data summary on all the variables
datasummary_skim( df )

# 3) Make descriptive statistics on the variable visits conditional on the gender
datasummary( as.factor( gender )*visits ~ 
               Mean + Median + SD + Min + Max + P25 + P75 + N + PercentMissing,
                  data = df )

# 4) Create a ggplot where you display the conditional distributions of visits given the gender
ggplot(df, aes( x = gender, y = as.factor( visits ) ) ) +
  geom_point( ) +
    labs( x = "gender",  y = "visits" )



# 5-6) Would you consider this a useful graph? Use instead a stacked bar graph!
#   a) create a new tibble, which groups by gender and visits and count the cases (summarise)
#   b) create a ggplot using aux with the geometry: geom_bar. 
#       You should specify the following arguments: stat = "identity", position = "fill"


# It is not useful as it does not give the distinct visit count by gender

# creating new tibble
stacked <- df %>% 
  group_by( gender , visits ) %>% 
  summarise("visit_count" = n() )

# stacked bar graph with new tibble
ggplot( data = stacked, aes( x = as.factor( visits ), y = visit_count, fill = gender ) ) +
  geom_bar( stat = "identity", position = "fill" )
labs( x = "no. of visits", y = "visit proportion", fill = "gender" )


# 7) Test whether the number of visits are the same for male and female
#   Hint: check the t.test function and use `~` sign to define the two groups.
#   You should have a Welch-Two Sample t-test and its results.
t.test( visits ~ gender, data = df )
