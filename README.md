# Coding 1: Data Management and Analysis with R

This repository is dedicated to all the assignments for Data Management and Analysis with R. In this course we had hands on experience with R, using many packages but focusing on tidyverse. I learnt to carry out a complete, reproducible data analysis project using R.

# Course Content:

1. R coding and general rules
2. Importing and exporting data.
3. Data wrangling (management, cleaning, set ready to analyse).
4. Visualization and carry out explanatory data analysis.
5. Creating your own functions, loops and simulations.
6. Implement Data Analysis theory in practice.
7. Create nice reports and presentations with RMarkdown.
8. Some advanced analysis tools; spatial and financial time-series econometrics.

# Final Project:

**Consumer Choice Model Regression Analysis**: [Term Project](https://github.com/nawalhasan/CEU_Coding-1-R/tree/master/final-project)
